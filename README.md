# Booking

About The Project
-------------
Booking is my first extensive project, which was created to develop my programming skills, implement good programming practices and create and solve problems in the process of developing application functionality.

BookingAPI is an application for the hotel room reservation system. The application allows you to browse available rooms, make reservations and manage them.

The application design uses the Onion architecture.The Onion architecture is based on the Dependency Inversion Principle and assumes the division of applications into layers that communicate with each other in a specific direction.

Main purpose of the app
-------------
BookingAPI is an application for the hotel room reservation system. The application allows you to browse available rooms, make reservations and manage them.

Getting Started
-------------
It's time to quickly talk about the application.

### Main layout
The front-end of my app is based on Blazor.

Let's start with searching for an interesting apartment.

### Search Apartament
To search for the apartment you are interested in, use the drop-down list and then press the search button.

Then choose the best apartment and press the check button. You will be redirected to the subpage create reservations.



### Create Reservation
The app will then ask you to enter the start and end dates for your booking. Unfortunately, date validation is not implemented yet.

### My Reservation
If all entered data is verified, the application will create a new reservation and redirect you to the My reservations subpage. Reservations related to the logged in account will appear on the subpage.

## It's still not everything

In the application, we have the ability to administer adding, modifying and deleting our reservations, rooms and photos

### Reservations
The reservations page allows us to remove a reservation.

### Rooms
The rooms page is more extensive and includes options to add, modify and delete rooms.
The method of modifying and deleting rooms is very similar to the Reservations subpage.

Data validation has been introduced in the form to avoid entering incorrect data. Update and delete
